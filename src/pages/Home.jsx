       This is my personal space to explore the art and strategy behind professional wrestling through the lens of evidence-based science and human behavior. From cognitive breakdowns of character arcs to biomechanical analysis of in-ring technique, I dive into the stories, psychology, and real-world science that make wrestling more than just entertainment. Whether you're a curious fan or a fellow thinker, you're invited to join me in decoding the squared circleâ€”one theory at a time.
